Ecommerce App

Overview This full-stack application that I built using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sass, and HTML will display a list of merchandises. The user may then choose an item and view its information and decide if they can purchase it. The app also allows the user to sign up and log into their account, doing so will open other transactions as adding, updating, editing, and deleting item information. While doing this project, I used the 7 RESTful routes.
